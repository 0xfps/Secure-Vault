# Secure-Vault

###

**Description**
A better, and secure ether vault.

**Info**
After going through 3 smart contract security techniques, I tried to write a better and more secure vault that checks 3 vulnerabilities that I have learn't so far:
- Arithmetic over/underflows.
- Reentrancy attacks.
- Forced ether.
